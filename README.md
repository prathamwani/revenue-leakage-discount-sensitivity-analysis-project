# revenue-leakage-discount-sensitivity-analysis-project
This project analyzes revenue leakage caused by aggressive discounting in a retail dataset. 
Using SQL for data exploration, Python for EDA, and Power BI for visualization, the project identifies how different discount bands impact profitability across categories and subcategories.

The analysis reveals that high discount levels consistently generate negative margins, especially in Machines, Tables, and Bookcases, while low discount strategies remain profitable across most categories.

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to highlight revenue leakage drivers, discount sensitivity, and profitability patterns, along with business recommendations to improve pricing strategy and reduce losses.
